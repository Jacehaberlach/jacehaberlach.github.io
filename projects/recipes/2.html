<ol>
	<li>Set oven rack in lowest position of oven and heat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
	<li>Thaw the chilled pie crust according to package directions, unroll and then fit into pie dish. Decorate as desired (I fold edges under just barely and push edges between fingertips to create a wavy design).</li>
	<li>In a mixing bowl whisk together pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice and salt until well blended.</li>
	<li>Once the oven is at its set temp place the pie into the oven for 1 hour</li>
