		<p>Chocolate Chip Cookies and Cookie dough me and my sister both love them so much that whenever my sister comes home from Virginia Tech she wants to bake and mix some ingredients with me and most of the time we have extra cookie dough that we don't put into the oven and we just eat off of the mixing bowl. Thats why i'm going to be making a recipe on how to make Chocolate chip cookie dough.</p>

		<h3>I have compiled the three steps for the recipe in the list below</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix butter, milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.</li>
  <li>Combine flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; slowly mix into butter mixture, beating on low speed with an electric mixer until dough is just combined.</li>
  <li>Fold chocolate chips into dough; drop by rounded tablespoon onto waxed paper.</li>
